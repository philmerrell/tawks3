                <p style="">The TAWKS Mobile Application is a prototype mobile device data collection program developed for the Time Allocation Workload Knowledge Study (TAWKS) at Boise State University. This mobile application collects data on faculty time allocation in order to develop knowledge about work habits and how those habits relate to productivity. The TAWKS Mobile Application uses a random time-sampling principle, rather than interval recording as seen in other time-tracking software. With the TAWKS Mobile Application, user fatigue is minimized while producing a statistically valid record of activities. The methodology is based in behavioral observation techniques unlike surveys and annual reporting. The TAWKs Mobile Application has been developed specifically for use in the higher education community, although it has conceivable uses beyond our industry.
